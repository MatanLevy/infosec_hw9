for the solution I used a dictonary data structure.
for each key-ip address I kept value - list of times the syn was sent
and each time a new syn is sent there is a check for this ip if the number of syn got in last minute was 15 or more and if so
we block this IP and remove it from dict and also add it to blocked set of ip's so next time each message from this ip will be 
blocked.
