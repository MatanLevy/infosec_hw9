the script just get each packet,check is not sent to us(local host 10.0.2.15) and if so,just send a response to the sender of SYN/ACK 
whick make the sender think the port is opened.
due to the fact we are on the same computer we will probably win each race and response each packet before the real response(if exist) from the real dst.
